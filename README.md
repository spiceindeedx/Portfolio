Here you can find my projects that I did during university stadies.

Currently, there are:
  Automation script that deploys infrastructure in AWS. You can also find a network diagram inside the folder (Terraform, shell script)
  CLI backup tool, that can help you make a backup of your directory. Needed logs will be written to the database which could be checked in localhost by launching Flask app. (Python)
  Example of the website frontend that I used in one of the group projects (HTML, CSS) 

Enjoy! ;)
